# Postman

A collection of [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) requests have been included to demonstrate the functionality of the Mock Data Holder.

In order to use the **Postman** requests:

1. Go to [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to download and install the Postman app.
2. Once installed, open the Postman app.
3. In the `Collections` section, click on the `Import` button.

5. Browse for the [mock-data-holder.postman_collection.json](mock-data-holder.postman_collection.json) file from the `Files` tab.

In order to make the mTLS requests (https://localhost:8001) in the Mock Data Holder collection, a client certificate needs to be added in the Postman app.  To add the client.pfx certificate:

1. In the Postman app, click on the `Settings` option from the `File` menu.

3. Add the `server.pfx` certificate for all requests to `https://localhost:8001`.
  - The `server.pfx` file can be found in the Mock Data Holder repository at: `CertificateManagement/mTLS/server.pfx`.
  - The password for the `server.pfx` certificate is `#M0ckDataHolder#`

4. The `server.pfx` certificate should now be sent to all Postman requests to the Mock Data Holder mTLS endpoint - `https://localhost:8001`.

5. In order to simulate requests from the Mock Data Recipient to the Mock Data Holder, a client certificate needs to be added in the Postman app. To add the client.pfx certificate you will need to obtain a copy from the [Mock Data Recipient](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-recipient) reopsitory.

6. Add the `client.pfx` certificate for all requests to  `https://localhost:8002`.

- The `client.pfx' file can be found in the Mock Data Recipient reporitory at: [mock-data-recipient/Source/CDR.DataRecipient.Web/Certificates/client.pfx](https://github.com/ConsumerDataRight/mock-data-recipient/tree/main/Source/CDR.DataRecipient.Web/Certificates/client.pfx)
- The password for the `client.pfx` certificate is  `#M0ckDataRecipient#`
